# Neural-Network
Neural network built from scratch in C++ for decryption.

## Installation/ Run

1. Run `make`, this will automatically run the program
2. A menu will pop up with options  
  (0): Give the model an input, and see what it predicts (usually this is run after you train the model using (1))  
  (1): Give the model an input/ output pair, and it will attempt to learn the mapping between them  
  (2): Train the model using a caesar cipher as the input, and attempts to learn to decrypt these strings  
  (3): Load the saved weights from the .txt file  
  (4): Save the current weights to various .txt files  
  (5): Exit
